# get_next_line

**Description:**

The `get_next_line` function is a custom file reading function implemented in C. It reads a line from a file descriptor (file stream) and returns it as a dynamically allocated string. This function is particularly useful for scenarios where reading from files with unknown or variable-length lines is necessary, such as reading from standard input or processing large text files.

**Key Features:**

- **Efficiency:** get_next_line reads the file in a buffered manner, allowing for efficient reading of large files without loading the entire file into memory at once.
  
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** It dynamically allocates memory for each line it reads, ensuring flexibility and scalability for varying line lengths.

- **File Descriptor Handling:** The function takes a file descriptor as input, enabling it to read from any file or standard input stream.

- **Error Handling:** get_next_line handles errors gracefully, returning -1 in case of errors such as file not found or read errors.

**Use Cases:**

- **Parsing Configuration Files:** Suitable for applications that need to parse configuration files with settings stored on separate lines.
  
- **Reading from Standard Input:** Useful for interactive command-line applications that require reading input line by line.
  
- **Processing Log Files:** Ideal for extracting and analyzing log data stored in text files with multiple lines.

**Project Origin:**

This function is part of the 42 curriculum, a coding education program where students develop projects to enhance their skills in various programming languages, including C. The get_next_line project is designed to improve understanding of file I/O operations, memory management, and string manipulation in the C programming language.
